1. Finds the number with the largest sequence of steps ending in one.
2. The default number range is one to one million. 
3. The range change is passed by specifying two arguments from and to. The second line of code.
4. Take into account the strong memory load and execution time when working with a range of large numbers. 
5. To calculate one number, specify the number itself in the range of the first argument, 
in the second argument add to the number plus one.
